- One of the auto-configuration features of our current Spring Application is the fact that whenever we initialize it, all the
data in the data.sql file gets populated onto our h2 database

- To create a table containing the particular columns of data desired, we use the following syntax:
create table person
(
	id integer not null,
	name varchar(255) not null,
	location varchar(255) not null,
	birth_date timestamp,
	primary key(id)
)

- not null means the data for that column cannot be blank, and varchar(255) means maximum 255 characters

- Query to rerun (since the h2 database is in-memory, this means that whenever we restart the application, all our data will
dissappear, we need to run this query again to add the data that we lost

INSERT INTO PERSON 
        (ID, NAME, LOCATION, BIRTH_DATE)
VALUES(10001, 'Adit', 'Toronto', sysdate());

- To see everything in the table Select * from person
