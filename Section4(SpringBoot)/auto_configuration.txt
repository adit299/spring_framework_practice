How exactly does Spring Auto Configuration work?

- It takes into account two key things:

(1) Spring Boot looks at frameworks available on the CLASSPATH

(2) Existing configuration for the application

- Essentially, autoconfiguration is what allows Spring to initialize all the beans necessary for the production quality 
attributes and the additional features Spring Provides (ex. Spring web MVC)

- If we add the following line of code into our application.properties file: logging.level.org.springframework = DEBUG,

- we are then able to see in the console exactly what dependencies Spring is intializing due to auto configuration
