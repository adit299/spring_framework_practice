Resolving Multiple Dependencies when Autowiring

1) @Primary - If two qualifying components are given, and we mark one of them with the Primary marker, that is the one
which will be used to initialize the class

2) Class Name - If a component has a matching name to one of its dependencies, Spring will automatically get the component
that has a matching name and use it to initialize the component

2) @Qualifier("<name>") - We can mark a particular component with this, and when autowiring we repeat this with the name of the
component that we want to initialize the component with. Then, we can specify which component we want to use when initializing
the component
