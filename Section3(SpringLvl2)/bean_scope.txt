Bean Scope

- By default in Spring, beans are set to be singleton, meaning one instance of the class is initialized when we try to obtain
it as a bean from the application context

- Thus, if we create two seperate variables and try to obtain the same bean from the application context, we will end
up with the identical instance of the class (bean)

- There are 3 other possible bean scopes:
Prototype: New bean whenever requested (we will obtain two difference instances of the class (two different beans)

request: One bean per HTTP request

session: One bean per HTTP session
